## How does Oracle and Redis store their data

You're correct! Let's clarify that distinction. In both **Oracle Database** and **Redis**, indexes are separate from the actual data and serve to optimize data retrieval rather than being part of the stored data itself. Hereâ€™s a refined comparison focusing solely on how data is stored, excluding indexing:

## Data Storage in Oracle Database

### 1. **Relational Model**
- **Tables**: Data is organized into structured tables, consisting of rows and columns. Each table represents an entity in the database.

### 2. **Data Files**
- **Physical Storage**: Data is stored in physical files on disk. These files contain the actual data for tables and can grow or shrink based on the contents.
- **Tablespaces**: Logical storage units that group one or more data files. Each tablespace contains segments that hold the data.

### 3. **Storage Structures**
- **Segments**: Each table or partition of a table is represented as a segment, which is a set of data blocks allocated for storing rows.
- **Data Blocks**: The smallest unit of storage in Oracle, where actual data rows are stored. The size of data blocks can vary (typically between 2 KB and 32 KB).
- **Row Format**: Rows are stored in a heap format or can be organized in clustered tables for related data.

### 4. **Persistence**
- **Durability**: Data is persisted on disk, ensuring data integrity and recovery through mechanisms like redo logs and backups.

## Data Storage in Redis

### 1. **In-Memory Storage**
- **Key-Value Pairs**: Data is stored as key-value pairs in memory, where each key points to a value that can be various data types.
  
### 2. **Data Structures**
- **Strings**: Basic key-value pairs where the value is a simple string.
- **Hashes**: Collections of key-value pairs, useful for representing objects with multiple fields.
- **Lists**: Ordered collections of strings, implemented as linked lists.
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique strings.
- **Sorted Sets**: Similar to sets but with an associated score for each element, allowing ordered access.

### 3. **Persistence Options**
- **RDB (Redis Database)**: Periodic snapshots of the dataset saved to disk, allowing for recovery.
- **AOF (Append-Only File)**: Logs every write operation, providing durability.

### 4. **Memory-Centric**
- **Primary Storage**: Data is primarily stored in memory (RAM), allowing for extremely fast access.

## Summary (Excluding Indexes)

| Feature                      | Oracle Database                                | Redis                                  |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Data Model**               | Relational (tables, rows, columns)            | Key-value pairs with various data types|
| **Physical Storage**         | Stored in data files on disk                   | Stored in memory (RAM)                 |
| **Logical Organization**      | Tablespaces, schemas, segments                 | Key-value store, data structures       |
| **Data Structures**          | Tables                                         | Strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets |
| **Persistence**              | Disk-based with robust recovery options        | In-memory with optional persistence (RDB, AOF) |

## Conclusion

- **Oracle Database** is optimized for structured, persistent data storage in a relational format, ensuring data integrity and durability.
- **Redis** is designed for high-speed, in-memory data storage, providing flexibility through various data structures.
