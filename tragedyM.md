### Tragedy M ─── A story on heterogeneous movements

### Prologue
It won't be *possible* if there is no two-way synchronization mechanism for a step by step database migration. 

### Trilemma
- No practical and feasible planning was done beforehand, especially on inter-project entanglements; 
- Under estimated project difficulties, especially on diversity of database access methods, no central data access layer exists and let alone API gateway; 
- No prior experience, suitable utilities and whatsoever; 

Should ask consultant agency for help on:
- What is the migration strategy? 
    1. Big Bang Migration: All data is migrated at once during a scheduled downtime.
    2. Trickle Migration: Data is migrated in phases to minimize downtime and risk.
- What are tools and Utilities employed? 
- How long does it takes and manpower involved? 

Post-Migration Monitoring after cutover: 
- Data Validation: Verify that the migrated data matches the source data in terms of accuracy and completeness.
- Functional Testing: Test the applications that rely on the database to ensure they function correctly with Oracle.
- Performance Testing: Assess the performance of queries and transactions in the new environment.
