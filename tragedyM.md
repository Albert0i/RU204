### Tragedy M ─── A story on heterogeneous movements

### Prologue
It won't be *possible* if there is no two-way synchronization mechanism for a step by step database migration. 

### Trilemma
- No practical and feasible planning was done beforehand, especially on inter-project entanglements; 
- Under estimated project difficulties, especially on diversity of database access methods, no central data access layer exists and let alone API gateway; 
- No prior experience, suitable utilities and whatsoever; 

Should ask consultant agency for help on:
- What is the migration strategy? 
    1. Big Bang Migration: All data is migrated at once during a scheduled downtime.
    2. Trickle Migration: Data is migrated in phases to minimize downtime and risk.
- What are tools and Utilities employed? 
- How long does it takes and manpower involved? 

Post-Migration Monitoring after cutover: 
- Data Validation: Verify that the migrated data matches the source data in terms of accuracy and completeness.
- Functional Testing: Test the applications that rely on the database to ensure they function correctly with Oracle.
- Performance Testing: Assess the performance of queries and transactions in the new environment.

### Out of focus
It started as a migration from DB2/400 to Oracle 12c. The very weigh should focus on Web Applications not on database itself. Moving data from one base to another without unworkable applications is meaningless and valueless. Data ,per se, is valuable, it is the applications visualize and utilize them and renders computer systems.
