In MySQL 8, you can use **FULLTEXT indexes** to perform full-text searches on text-based columns. FULLTEXT search is particularly useful for searching large amounts of text data efficiently. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to create and use FULLTEXT indexes in MySQL 8, along with concrete examples.

### Example Setup

#### Step 1: Create a Sample Database and Table

First, let’s create a sample database and a table that will hold some text data.

```sql
-- Create the Sample Database
CREATE DATABASE SampleDB;
USE SampleDB;

-- Create the Articles Table
CREATE TABLE Articles (
    ArticleID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(255),
    Body TEXT,
    FULLTEXT (Title, Body)  -- Create a FULLTEXT index on Title and Body
);
```

#### Step 2: Insert Sample Data

Next, insert some sample data into the `Articles` table.

```sql
INSERT INTO Articles (Title, Body) VALUES
('MySQL Full-Text Search', 'This article explains how to use FULLTEXT search in MySQL.'),
('Understanding Indexes', 'Indexes are important for optimizing query performance.'),
('Advanced SQL Techniques', 'Learn about advanced techniques in SQL, including joins and subqueries.'),
('Using MySQL for Data Analysis', 'MySQL can be used for efficient data analysis with proper indexing.');
```

### Step 3: Performing a FULLTEXT Search

Now that we have our data set up, you can perform a FULLTEXT search using the `MATCH()` function combined with `AGAINST()`.

#### Basic FULLTEXT Search

To search for articles that contain the word "MySQL":

```sql
SELECT * FROM Articles
WHERE MATCH (Title, Body) AGAINST ('MySQL');
```

### Step 4: Using Boolean Mode

You can also use Boolean mode for more advanced searches. This allows you to use operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and others.

#### Example: Searching with Boolean Mode

To find articles that must contain the word "MySQL" but can exclude "Data":

```sql
SELECT * FROM Articles
WHERE MATCH (Title, Body) AGAINST ('+MySQL -Data' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
```

### Step 5: Full-Text Search with Natural Language Mode

You can also perform a natural language search without Boolean operators:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Articles
WHERE MATCH (Title, Body) AGAINST ('SQL techniques');
```

### Conclusion

FULLTEXT search in MySQL 8 is powerful for querying text data efficiently. By creating FULLTEXT indexes and utilizing the `MATCH()` function with `AGAINST()`, you can effectively perform complex searches across text columns.
